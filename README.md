# Symptom Parser

A simple parser that reads data from CSV, TSV, JSON, and XML formats to create a dictionary of symptoms.

## Features
- Supports multiple data formats.
- Creates a symptom dictionary.

## Step 1: Read Data and Create a Dictionary

In this step, the program performs the following actions:

1. **Read Data**: The parser can read data from various formats, including CSV, TSV, JSON, and XML.
2. **Create a Dictionary**: It extracts symptoms and their attributes from the dataset to build a structured dictionary.

The resulting dictionary serves as a reference for symptoms and their corresponding details, which can be enhanced in subsequent steps.
